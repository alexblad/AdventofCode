# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles. I'm using this as a way to practice my problem-solving skills and experiment with different programming languages.

## My Approach
My main goal is to first find a correct solution, and then iterate upon that initial solution to find a more efficient approach to solving each problem.

## Running the Code

Solutions are organized by year and then by day (e.g., `2020/Day1`).
